Asymmetric/Symmetric Cryptography.

Asymmetric Cryptography uses a pair of PRIVATE/PUBLIC keys for the cryptography process:    EXAMPLE => public key cryptography
Symmetric key cryptography on the other hand uses only one key for the process, simpletr.   EXAMPLE => TLS cryptography

Public key cryptography relies on an ELLIPTIC CURVE MULTIPLICATION. 
It mathematically links the private and public keys. 

Having the PRIVATE key one can derive the PUBLIC key but the inverse is impossible.

Trapdoor Functions [a.k.a Hash Functions.]

A one way (deterministic) function, that takes a data of an arbitrary length and compresses it to a data sequence of a predetermined length, which is (ideally) completely random.

Trapdoor functions should
    - be deterministic & be one-way, CANNOT RETRIEVE THE INPUT FROM THE OUTPUT
    - have a large number space, [IDEALLY INFINITE] => reduce clashes.
    - generate small enough sequence to transport over HTTP.
    - should generate the same output for a given input EVERY TIME.
